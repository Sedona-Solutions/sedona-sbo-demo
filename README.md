Sedona Back Office (sbo) demo application
=========================================

A demo for the sedona-sbo Bundles that can be found on:
https://github.com/Sedona-Solutions/sedona-sbo

In this demo, the CRUD for all entities has already been generated,
but you can try to update entities and regenerate to check the changes.

A script has been added to rebuild all:
 ```
 bin/generate-all-bo
 ```
